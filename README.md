### BuildAWT Application

## Problem Statement

People who exercise often follow workout plans when they go to the gym. But doing the same routine can get boring after a while, what if there was a way to create and edit your own workouts?

## Problem Solution

BuildAWT (pronounced “build-out”) is a workout building tool used to compile personal workouts that you can re-use, edit or delete. It is your number one companion to figure out what you want to do at the gym or anywhere you plan to train.

Search from the list of exercises available in the exercises page (exercises are curated and obtained from the wger API) and add them to your very own workout routine. Devise multiple workouts for different days or muscle groups. You can also add various tags to each exercise to customise the intensity for the way you want to train.
